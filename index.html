      <h2>The Birth of Dom Potato</h2>
      <p>
        Four men walked into a potato farm in the dead of winter, determined to redefine what it meant to wear potatoes. They didn’t just want to make garments; they wanted to build a lifestyle. They wanted to craft potato-infused fashion so outlandish, so absurd, that it could only be described as... legendary.
      </p>
      <p>
        But as their journey continued, things started to fall apart. The potatoes were too perfect. The fabrics too luxurious. The world wasn’t ready. And the four men? Well, they left their story unfinished, each wandering off into different potato fields, leaving behind the grand vision of Dom Potato — for now.
      </p>
      <p>
        *To be continued... or maybe not.*
